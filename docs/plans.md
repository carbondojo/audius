# Near-term Plans

Audius is a very small project that I started to provide a proper way to download audio files. This was only for educational purposes. But here are a few features that I would like to implement into the app.

## To-Do

- [x] Allow users to stream audio before downloading
- [x] Ability to automatically embed ID3 metadata into the downloaded songs
- [ ] Allow YouTube and Spotify links instead of just search strings
- [ ] Ability to downlaod an entire album in one go
- [ ] Write a more accurate algorithm to select the proper audio from YouTube search results
- [ ] Fix metadata of songs that are previsously present in local storage
- [ ] Ditch the use of a prebuilt module to embed ID3 data and move to native JS code
- [ ] Add a more user-friendly audio player
